#  A Pixel Art Club of Purdue (A PAC of P)

We are one of the pixel art clubs of Purdue! We do not know if any pixel art specific clubs exist, but many other art or animation clubs do exist. However, we specialize in pixel art. Currently, the club is comprised of a small group of friends but always willing to expand and incorporate more people into our journies, and into their journies, of learning pixel art!
